# Quantized Models with AutoGGUF

This repository provides tools and scripts for quantizing neural network models using various advanced quantization methods. It leverages the Hugging Face ecosystem and custom toolchains to manage models efficiently, making them suitable for deployment in environments where resources are constrained.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to clone, quantize, and manage your models using our scripts.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Git
- Python 3.6+
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Follow these steps to quantize your models:

Set Up Your Environment:
Ensure that your Hugging Face token is securely stored in your environment variables or Google Colab secrets.
Run the Quantization Script:
Execute the main script to quantize the model:
bash
Copy code
python quantize_model.py
Manage Quantized Models:
Use the provided scripts to upload your quantized models to the Hugging Face Hub:
